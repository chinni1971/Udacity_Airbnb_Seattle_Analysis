While there is plenty of parking, you may not even need your car to enjoy what Seattle has to offer, as my 1905 home has a Walk Score of 91 and Bike Score of 85. This is one of the original houses in the Wallingford neighborhood, built in 1905.  It was built at the very back of the lot (though in 1905 it was at the base of a small hill, now my neighbor's back yard), and subsequently has a big front yard and plenty of air space around the house.  Many of the houses in Wallingford are built quite close together, but my house has clear access to sunshine and garden views, particularly on the south side. The neighborhood used to be covered by an apple orchard, and we have one of the original trees, a Gravenstein apple tree. Since this is a room in a house, you have full access to the shared places in the house:  kitchen, living room, yard.  You know, like a normal house.
